# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

The root module structure is as follows:
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules

### Terraform Cloud Variables
In terraform cloud, we have two types of variables:
- Terraform Variables - variables to be set in .tfvars file e.g user_uuid
- Environment Variables - variables to be set in bash terminal e.g Cloud service provider secrets (GCP SECRETS)

We can set variables to be sensitive in cloud, and they are stored in vault

### Loading Terraform Variables
- var flags:
To load the terraform variables, we can use the `-var` to set an input variable or overide a variable in the .tfvars file e.g `terraform plan -var user_uuid="my-user-uuid"`
- vars-file
- terraform.tfvars file
- auto.tfvars
- order of terraform variables

## Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If by chance you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually. That looks like impossible??

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps i.e. 

If we run Terraform plan is with attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift

## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommend to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

## Working with Files in Terraform


### Fileexists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

### Filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module
[Special Path Variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)


resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
}

## Terraform Locals

Locals allows us to define local variables.
It can be very useful when we need transform data into another format and have referenced a varaible.

```tf
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "MyS3Origin"
}
```
[Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)

## Terraform Data Sources

This allows use to source data from cloud resources.

This is useful when we want to reference cloud resources without importing them.

```tf
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```
[Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

## Working with JSON

We use the jsonencode to create the json policy inline in the hcl.

```tf
jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}
```

[jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)

## Terraform Data

Plain data values such as Local Values and Input Variables don't have any side-effects to plan against and so they aren't valid in replace_triggered_by. You can use terraform_data's behavior of planning an action each time input changes to indirectly use a plain value to trigger replacement.

## Provisioners

Provisioners allow you to execute commands on compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuration Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

### Local-exec

This will execute command on the machine running the terraform commands eg. plan apply

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec

### Remote-exec

This will execute commands on a machine which you target. You will need to provide credentials such as ssh to get into the machine.

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```
